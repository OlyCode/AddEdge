AddEdge
=======

AddEdge is an analyzer for the Forbidden Graph combinatorial game. 
In the Forbidden Graph game, players are given a set of verticies. 
Players take turns adding edges to the graph, but players are not 
allowed create certain types of *forbidden* graphs. The first player 
that is unable to add an edge, loses.

The program analyzes the Nim values of games of Forbidden Graph 
given different types of forbidden graphs (complete graphs, path 
graphs, wheel graphs, and cycle graphs).
